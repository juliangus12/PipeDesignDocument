## 1. Lack of Comprehensive Documentation

The repository lacks a comprehensive README or documentation that provides a clear overview of the project's purpose, its structure, and how to use the provided code. This absence can make it challenging for users to navigate the repository, understand its objectives, and replicate the results.

**Impact on Reproducibility**: Without clear instructions, users might not execute scripts in the correct order or might miss essential steps, leading to errors or inconsistent results.

---

## 2. Missing List of Dependencies

The repository does not provide a clear list of required R packages or dependencies. Users might encounter errors when trying to run the scripts due to missing packages.

**Impact on Reproducibility**: Missing dependencies can halt the execution of scripts, preventing users from reproducing the results. It can also lead to discrepancies if users install different versions of the required packages.

---

## 3. Order of Operations

The repository does not specify the order in which the scripts should be executed. For users unfamiliar with the project, this can lead to confusion and potential errors.

**Possible Script Order?**
- Prior Scripts
  - `SourceCode/Prior2SourceMu.R`
  - `SourceCode/Prior2SourceStat.R`
- Batch Means Script
  - `SourceCode/batchmeans.R`
- Projection Scripts
  - `projections/CCSM4.R`
  - `projections/CanESM2.R`
  - `projections/GFDLESM2M.R`
  - `projections/GFDLesm2m_WRF.R`
- Figure Scripts
  - `Figure/design_pipe.R`
  - `Figure/precip_estimates.R`
  - `Figure/precip_projections.R`

**Impact on Reproducibility**: Running scripts out of order can lead to errors, missing data, incorrect results, and corrupted PDFs.

---

## 4. Hardcoded Values

Many of the files contain hardcoded values and paths. This can lead to potential errors if the code is executed in a different environment or if there are changes in the directory structure.

**Impact on Reproducibility**: Hardcoded paths or values can cause scripts to fail if the user's environment doesn't match the original setup. This can prevent users from reproducing the results.

---

## 5. Code Comments and Consistency

A majority of files in the repository lack descriptive comments, making it difficult for users or contributors unfamiliar with the project to understand the code's functionality and purpose. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in naming conventions and code structure across different files.

**Impact on Reproducibility**: Without clear comments, users might misinterpret the purpose of certain code sections, leading to potential misuse. Inconsistent code can also confuse users and make the codebase harder to navigate.

---

## Recommendations

- **Documentation**: Provide a comprehensive README that offers an overview of the project, its objectives, and a step-by-step guide on how to use the code.
- **Dependencies**: List all required R packages and dependencies. Consider providing a script or a configuration file to automate the installation process.
- **Order of Operations**: Clearly specify the sequence in which scripts should be executed to achieve the desired results.
- **Refactor Code**: Remove hardcoded values and paths. Consider parameterizing these values or providing configuration options. Ensure consistent naming conventions and code structure across all files.
- **Enhance Code Comments**: Add descriptive comments throughout the codebase to explain the functionality and purpose of the code sections.
